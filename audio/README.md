# Audio Samples

Here you can find some samples to use as audio context to test the model. All of these (except for `cake.wav`) come from a held-out set from the [MoisesDB](https://github.com/moises-ai/moises-db) dataset. 

The model was not trained on any of these samples nor any other sample coming from the same songs as these ones.
